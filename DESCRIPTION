Description: 
    markeR provides a suite of methods for using gene sets (signatures) to quantify and evaluate the 
    extent to which a given gene signature marks a specific phenotype. The package implements various 
    scoring, enrichment and classification approaches, along with tools to compute 
    performance metrics and visualize results, making it a valuable resource for transcriptomics research (bulk RNA-seq).
