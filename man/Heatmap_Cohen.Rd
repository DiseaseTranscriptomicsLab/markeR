\title{Generate Heatmaps for Cohen\'s d Effect Sizes using ggplot2}
\usage{
Heatmap_Cohen(
  cohenlist,
  nrow = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  limits = NULL,
  widthTitle = 22,
  titlesize = 12,
  ColorValues = NULL,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohenlist}{A named list where each element corresponds to a gene signature. Output of \code{CohenD_allConditions}. Each signature element is a list with three components:
\describe{
\item{CohenD}{A data frame where rows are methods and columns are group contrasts (formatted as \"Group1:Group2\"),
containing the computed Cohen\'s d effect sizes.}
\item{PValue}{A data frame with the same structure as \code{CohenD} containing the corresponding p-values.}
\item{padj}{A data frame with the same structure as \code{PValue} containing the corresponding p-values corrected using the BH method, for all signatures and contrasts,
and by method.}
}}

\item{nrow}{Optional. An integer specifying the number of rows in the heatmap grid. If \code{NULL}, the number of rows
is computed automatically.}

\item{ncol}{Optional. An integer specifying the number of columns in the heatmap grid. If \code{NULL}, the number of columns
is computed automatically.}

\item{limits}{Optional. A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the color scale limits (e.g., \code{c(min, max)}). If \code{NULL},
the limits are determined from the data.}

\item{widthTitle}{An integer specifying the width used for wrapping gene set signature names in the heatmap titles. Default is 22.}

\item{titlesize}{An integer specifying the text size for each of the heatmap titles. Default is 12.}

\item{ColorValues}{A character vector specifying the colors for the gradient fill in the heatmaps. Default is \code{c("#F9F4AE", "#B44141")}.}

\item{title}{Title for the grid of plots.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{plt}{A combined heatmap arranged in a grid using \code{ggpubr::ggarrange}.}
\item{data}{A list containing the Cohen\'s d effect sizes and p-values for each gene signature, as computed by \code{CohenD_allConditions}.}
}
}
\description{
This function computes Cohen\'s d effect sizes and corresponding p-values for multiple gene signatures and produces individual heatmaps. Each heatmap displays cell text showing the Cohen\'s d value along with its p-value. The heatmaps are then arranged in a grid layout.
}
\details{
The function first calculates Cohen\'s d effect sizes and corresponding p-values for each gene signature using \code{CohenD_allConditions} (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the package). The resulting matrices are converted to a long format so that each cell in the heatmap can display the Cohen\'s d value and its associated p-value (formatted as \code{Cohen\'s d (p-value)}).

The heatmaps are then adjusted to display axis text and ticks only for the left-most column and bottom row, and combined into a grid layout. If neither \code{nrow} nor \code{ncol} are specified, the layout is automatically determined to best approximate a square grid.
