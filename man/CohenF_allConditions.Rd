\title{Compute Cohen's f for All Gene Signatures Across a Categorical Variable}
\usage{
CohenF_allConditions(data, metadata, gene_sets, variable)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of gene expression data, with genes as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{metadata}{A data frame containing sample metadata. The first column should contain sample identifiers matching
the column names of \code{data}.}

\item{gene_sets}{A named list of gene sets. For unidirectional gene sets, each element is a vector of gene names;
for bidirectional gene sets, each element is a data frame where the first column contains gene names and the second
column indicates the expected direction (1 for upregulated, -1 for downregulated).}

\item{variable}{A string specifying the categorical variable in \code{metadata} used to model the gene signature scores.}
}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a gene signature. Each signature element is a list with three components:
\describe{
\item{CohenF}{A data frame where rows are scoring methods and columns are the variable used in the linear model (usually one column),
containing the computed Cohen's f effect size.}
\item{PValue}{A data frame of the corresponding raw p-values from the linear model for each method.}
\item{padj}{A data frame of adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg method) across signatures and contrasts, per method.}
}
}
\description{
Computes Cohen's f effect sizes and corresponding p-values for all gene signatures using scores calculated
by multiple methods. The function first computes gene signature scores using \code{CalculateScores} with the "all"
option, flattens the results, and fits linear models using the specified variable to estimate effect sizes.
}
\details{
This function is designed for use with categorical variables, where the goal is to evaluate the overall group effect
(e.g., using ANOVA) across multiple levels.
