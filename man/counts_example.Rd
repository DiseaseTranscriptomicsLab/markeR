\description{
A numeric matrix containing filtered and normalized gene expression data from the Marthandan et al. (2016) study (GEO accession GSE63577).
}
\details{
Raw FASTQ files were downloaded using \code{fasterq-dump} (v2.11.0) and processed in a reproducible conda environment (Python v3.11.5).
Quality control was conducted using FastQC (v0.12.1) and summarised with MultiQC (v1.14). Pseudo-alignment to the RefSeq transcriptome (NCBI release 109)
was performed using kallisto (v0.44.0). Genes with low expression (mean count < 70 in all conditions) were filtered out. Count normalization factors were
calculated with \code{edgeR::calcNormFactors}, and log2-transformed values were obtained via \code{limma::voom}.

Intermediate time points for HFF and MRC5 cell lines were excluded, resulting in a final dataset with 45 high-quality samples across proliferative, quiescent,
and senescent conditions.
