\title{Calculate Log-Median Scores for Unidirectional Gene Sets}
\usage{
calculateScore_logmedian_unidirectional(data, signature)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of normalized counts (genes as rows, samples as columns).}

\item{signature}{A vector of gene names or a data frame where the first column contains gene names.}
}
\value{
A named vector with log-median-centered scores per sample.
}
\description{
Computes log-median-centered scores for gene signatures where all genes are expected to be enriched in
the same direction, or when direction is not known.
