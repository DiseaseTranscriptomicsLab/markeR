\title{markeR: A Toolkit for Evaluating Gene Signatures as Phenotype Markers}
\description{
The \strong{markeR} package provides methods to analyze gene signatures and assess their
relevance in marking specific phenotypes. It includes tools for score-based evaluation,
enrichment analysis, and machine-learning classification.
}
\section{Methods}{

The package implements three main approaches for gene signature analysis:

\strong{1. Score-based Methods:} These approaches compute a numerical score representing
the expression of a gene signature per sample.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Log2 Median-Centered Scoring:} Measures signature expression by centering expression
values relative to their median.
\item \strong{Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA):} Calculates an enrichment score
for a given gene set in each sample.
}

\strong{2. Enrichment-based Methods:} These methods evaluate whether a gene signature
is significantly enriched in a ranked gene list.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA):} A rank-based method for testing enrichment
significance in predefined gene sets.
}

\strong{3. Classification-based Methods:} These approaches classify samples into
phenotypic groups based on gene signature expression.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Random Forest Classification:} Uses decision trees to predict sample labels based
on gene signature scores.
}
}

\section{Main Functions and Future Modules}{

The current release of \strong{markeR} includes two primary functions for score-based analysis:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{CalculateScores}}: Calculates gene signature scores for each sample using either the ssGSEA or log2 median-centered method.
\item \code{\link{PlotScores}}: Visualizes the calculated scores across conditions using violin plots.
}
Future updates will expand the package with similar pairs of functions for:
\itemize{
\item Enrichment-based analysis (to calculate and visualize GSEA statistics).
\item Classification-based analysis (to train classifiers, for example, using Random Forests, and to evaluate performance, e.g., via ROC curves).
\item Gene-level visualization modules that display the expression patterns of individual genes within the signatures, for example, using heatmaps.
