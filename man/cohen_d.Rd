\title{Compute Cohen's d Effect Size}
\usage{
cohen_d(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the values for group 1.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the values for group 2.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing Cohen's d. Returns NA if either group has fewer than two observations
or if the pooled standard deviation is zero.
}
\description{
Computes the absolute Cohen's d effect size between two numeric vectors. This function returns
the absolute value of the difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation.
}
\examples{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
