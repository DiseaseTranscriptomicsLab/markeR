\title{markeR: A Toolkit for Evaluating Gene Signatures as Phenotype Markers}
\description{
The \strong{markeR} package provides methods to analyze gene signatures and assess their
relevance in marking specific phenotypes. It includes tools for score-based evaluation,
enrichment analysis, and machine-learning classification.
}
\section{Methods}{

The package implements three main approaches for gene signature analysis:

\strong{1. Score-based Methods:} These approaches compute a numerical score representing
the expression of a gene signature per sample.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Log2 Median-Centered Scoring:} Measures signature expression by centering expression
values relative to their median.
\item \strong{Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA):} Calculates an enrichment score
for a given gene set in each sample.
}

\strong{2. Enrichment-based Methods:} These methods evaluate whether a gene signature
is significantly enriched in a ranked gene list.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA):} A rank-based method for testing enrichment
significance in predefined gene sets.
}

\strong{3. Classification-based Methods:} These approaches classify samples into
phenotypic groups based on gene signature expression.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Random Forest Classification:} Uses decision trees to predict sample labels based
on gene signature scores.
}
}

\section{Features}{

\itemize{
\item Flexible tools for computing gene signature scores.
\item Visualization functions to compare signatures across conditions.
\item Machine-learning models for phenotype classification.
\item Tools for validating and refining gene signatures.
}
