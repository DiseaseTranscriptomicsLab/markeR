\title{Calculate Log-Median Scores for Bidirectional Gene Sets}
\usage{
calculateScore_logmedian_bidirectional(data, signature)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of normalized counts (genes as rows, samples as columns).}

\item{signature}{A data frame with:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{first column} containing gene names.
\item The \strong{second column} specifying enrichment direction (\code{1} for upregulated, \code{-1} for downregulated).
}}
}
\value{
A named vector with log-median-centered scores per sample.
}
\description{
Computes gene signature scores considering both upregulated and downregulated genes separately,
then calculates a differential score by subtracting downregulated from upregulated scores.
